# 10 Academy July 2020 Training - Weekly Challenge: Week 3
Change-Point-Analysis-of-Covid19-Bayesian-Inference-SIR-Modelling

Using Ethiopia as a case study:

## Change point analysis to quantify the impact of African government policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19
### Business objective
The main objective of this challenge is to quantify the statistical significance of a public health policy introduced by Ethiopia governments to slow down the spread of COVID-19 and quantify the impact of the political instablity in the spread of COVID-19.



### Data
The data that we have used comes from Ethiopian minster of health minster official facebook page.
