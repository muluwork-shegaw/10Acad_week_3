# 10 Academy July 2020 Training - Weekly Challenge: Week 3
Change-Point-Analysis-of-Covid19-Bayesian-Inference-SIR-Modelling

Using Ethiopia as a case study:

## Change point analysis to quantify the impact of African government policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19
### Business objective
The main business objective of this challenge is to quantify the statistical significance of a public health policy introduced by African governments to slow down the spread of COVID-19. Situational Overview (Business Need) The African Union has hired a data science consultant, to gather insights from across the continent on which public health and social measures are most effective at reducing the spread of Covid-19. The contract states that they are looking for evidence-based insights and they want to learn from existing initiatives launched a competition for all Young African Data Scientists to provide evidence-based insight on the effectiveness of recent public health government policies in the continent as it relates to Covid-19.

The contract is to investigate  which interventions had the most effect on the Ethiopia under study. 

### Data
The data that will be used comes from the COVID-19 project by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The python package that comes with the key code (Priesmann et al.) already contains a python class to download the relevant data from John Hopkins database.
